1. Raises self-awareness
   Working on your personal development is an opportunity to do some
   self-evaluation. It calls your attention to the aspects of yourself that
   need improvement. Through this exercise, you develop a clearer picture of
   your core values and get in touch with your authentic self.
2. Gives you a confidence boost
   As you see the positive results of improving yourself, you gain more
   confidence. And when you work on areas you’ve identified as your weaknesses,
   you transform them into personal strengths, making you even more confident
   in your abilities.
3. Strengthens you
   As you continue to work on self-improvement, you will naturally work on improving your key strengths. You will learn how to utilize what you’re good at in order to get closer to your goals.
